## 🚀 Hey there, GitHub Universe! 🚀

I'm the go-to guy for all things **Computer Science**, **WebDev** and **competitive programming**, currently shaping the minds of future young code wizards 🧙‍♂️ since September 2020 in Aktau. My arsenal includes both Python 🐍 and C++, but let's be real - Python and I share a special bond. Despite my leanings, my students seem to have a sweet spot for C++ - go figure! 😄

Beyond the classroom, I've dabbled in the world of RPA development, wielding tools like UiPath and Automation Anywhere from 2019 to 2021, crafting solutions that work like magic. ✨

Fast forward to the past year (Oct 2022 - Oct 2023), I dove headfirst into the Data Analytics realm, graduating from the Masterschool - Data Analytics Program. 📊 My sights are now set on becoming a Kaggle Grandmaster. Watch this space, the data saga continues! 🌌

As we speak (Feb 2024 - ), I'm on a new quest learning Svelte to build a portfolio-blog-course website that's uniquely mine. My vision? To craft something as breathtaking as [https://pudding.cool/](https://pudding.cool/) - trust me check it out, it's worth your time! 🖥️

And oh, did I mention? I run a nifty little YouTube channel in Kazakh, bringing a dash of my world to yours. 🎥

Stay tuned, and let's make coding cooler together! 💻🌟
